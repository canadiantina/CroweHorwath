# CroweHorwath

Write a ‘Hello World’ program.
--The program has 1 current business requirement – write “Hello World” to the console/screen.
--The program should have an API that is separated from the program logic to eventually support mobile applications, web applications, or console applications, or windows services.
--The program should support future enhancements for writing to a database, console application, etc.
	--Use common design patterns (inheritance, e.g.) to account for these future concerns.
	--Use configuration files or another industry-standard mechanism for determining where to write the information to.
Write unit tests to support the API.
